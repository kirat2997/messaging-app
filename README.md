# messaging-app
Ever wondered how WhatsApp was built and scaled to support a user
base of half a billion? Most startups use Slack as their internal
communication tool. Facebook too has launched a Workplace app to
be used by businesses.
The task is to build a flexible, scalable and robust Web based messaging
app similar to Slack. We understand that building a messaging app may
seem too simple for rockstars like you. So features like groups, mentions,
integration with external tools, bots are always welcome. Please keep in
mind that we won’t bother much about the features. The features are
only a way for you to implement complex designs and give you room for
innovation.
We will be mainly looking for design, use cases, test cases and of course,
your code. Please keep scalability and extensibility in mind.
I would also like to point out that only the people completing the task
would go on to the next round.
There is no restriction as to what tools you can use as long as it doesn’t
overshadow your contribution to the task itself. We are of the opinion
that tools would hinder your ability to showcase your skills. However, we
also understand that as the complexity of your app increases, tools will
allow you to adhere to the deadline.
